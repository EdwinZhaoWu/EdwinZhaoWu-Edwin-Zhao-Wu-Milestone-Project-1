    <h2>Bonobos Share A Total of 98.7 Percent Of Human Genetic Makeup!</h2>
    <p>The correct answer to the first question is 98.7 percent! Our closest cousins, bonobos share 98.7 percent of our genetic makeup. They are about two-thirds the size of humans and are covered with dark hair. They are distinguished by their black faces, red lips, two or three webbed toes, a tail tuft, and parted long hair. If you want to learn more about bonobos and how we can save them, feel free to go back to the bonobos page!</p>
